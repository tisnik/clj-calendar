# clj-calendar

This library contains set of functions that could be useful for working with
the calendar, date, and time values. Library is divided into two modules named
*calendar* and *format-datetime*. The first module contains various functions
to get current time, format time etc. The second module contains functions that
can convert a given date (or difference between two dates) into human readable
sentence like: "one day and 2 hours ago" etc.
